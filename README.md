## Contribution Process
1. `git checkout` to create a branch different from `master`.
2. Add new features / fix bugs in the newly-created branch.
3. Push changes to remote repo on own account, pushing the new branching as well.
4. Create new PR to `master`.
5. Wait till PR was reviewed by maintainer.
6. If PR was rejected, jump to step 2.
